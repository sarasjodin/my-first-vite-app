## More about my-first-vite-app

A simple, client-side course handler built with Vite, TypeScript, and plain HTML/CSS.

This app allows users to add, view, and clear university courses.
Each course includes a course code, name, progression level (A, B, or C), and a syllabus link.
Courses are persisted using localStorage, and can optionally be loaded from an external or local JSON file.

The UI is styled using vanilla CSS and built without frameworks.
The app is structured in a modular way, making use of TypeScript interfaces,
strict typing, and encapsulated utility files (ui.ts, storage.ts, api.ts, etc.).

This is a beginner learning project focused on exploring TypeScript fundamentals,
separation of concerns, and a modern build process using Vite.
